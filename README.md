I am planning on working on...

### Codecks API Wrapper

Trello is pretty much the norm for Roblox developers to organize their work. I plan on making this wrapper so that
anybody can connect Codecks and Roblox together, like you could with Trello and Roblox. 

This is most likely not going to come out until at least December of this year, due to the fact that 
in the official [Codecks roadmap card for API](https://open.codecks.io/codecks-roadmap/decks/2567-roadmap-major-features/card/1awz-api-docs), it is supposed to come out in Q3.
