# Introduction

Hi, I'm SpiritualSonicdash, but you can call me Spirit, Spiritual, SpiritualDash, or SpiritualsFate!
I am a developer for Roblox as of right now, but I code in multiple different fields!

# Projects

I am currently working on...

### [Conjoined Creators](https://web.roblox.com/games/9287236335/Conjoined-Creators)

Conjoined Creators is a game that is about joining with the whole playerbase to control one "BloxTube account" and garner
a lot of subscribers.

It was created on April 5, 2022, and is currently not released fully. It is public, and is on a showcase build status.

I am planning on working on...

### Codecks API Wrapper

Trello is pretty much the norm for Roblox developers to organize their work. I plan on making this wrapper so that
anybody can connect Codecks and Roblox together, like you could with Trello and Roblox. 

This is most likely not going to come out until at least December of this year, due to the fact that 
in the official [Codecks roadmap card for API](https://open.codecks.io/codecks-roadmap/decks/2567-roadmap-major-features/card/1awz-api-docs), it is supposed to come out in Q3.
